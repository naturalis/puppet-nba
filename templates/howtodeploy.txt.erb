To manually deploy a .ear file just overwrite the .ear file to
/opt/wildfly/wildfly_deployments/<%= scope.lookupvar("nba::application_name") %>

Please note that the filename SHOULD BE <%= scope.lookupvar("nba::application_name") %>

After copy the .ear will be redeployed. No need to delete the existing .ear

You can check the deployment by checking the content of /opt/wildfly/wildfly_deployments

* <%= scope.lookupvar("nba::application_name") %>.deployed -> ear is deployed
* <%= scope.lookupvar("nba::application_name") %>.isdeploying -> ear is deploying
* <%= scope.lookupvar("nba::application_name") %>.failed -> deployment failed. You can read the <%= scope.lookupvar("nba::application_name") %>.failed
